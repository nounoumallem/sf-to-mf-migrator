## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: 🔍 Analyze

Before starting migration, click Analyze Data to:
- Check how many users have favorites

- Verify both plugins are installed
- Ensure database compatibility

What to check:
- ✅ Number of users with favorites

---

### Step 2: 🚀 Migrate

Transfer all favorites from Simple Favorites to My Favorites format.

What happens:

- Shows progress in real-time

This process:
- ✅ Does NOT delete original data
- ✅ Can be run multiple times safely

---

### Step 3: ✅ Verify

Compare both systems to ensure 100% data integrity.

Verification checks:
- User counts match
- Favorite counts match
- Individual user data matches
- Displays any discrepancies

Important: Do not proceed to cleanup until verification shows 100% match!

---

### Step 4: 🔄 Replace Shortcodes

Automatically update shortcodes throughout your entire site:

Replacements made:

Safe features:

- ✅ Shortcodes are working correctly
- ✅ You have a database backup

What gets removed:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I deactivate during migration?

The process will stop, but no data will be lost. You can reactivate and continue.

### Do I need to keep this plugin installed?

After successful migration and cleanup, you can safely deactivate and delete this plugin.

No, if you follow the process correctly, all favorites will be preserved perfectly.

### Does this work with multisite?

Currently, this plugin is designed for single-site installations. Multisite support is planned for future versions.
